# PropertyChangeSupport
JavaBeans are reusable software components written in the Java programming language that conform to certain conventions about their structure, naming, and behavior. They are designed to be easily manipulated visually in a builder tool, like GUI builders in IDEs, and to be easily integrated into applications.

The JavaBeans event model allows JavaBeans components to generate events and have other components register listeners to be notified when these events occur. This is crucial for building interactive applications, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), where components need to respond to user actions or changes in state.

The PropertyChangeSupport class provides a simple mechanism for managing listeners and firing property change events. It maintains a list of registered listeners and provides methods to add, remove, and notify listeners when a property's value changes.

Overall, the PropertyChangeSupport class simplifies the implementation of the observer pattern within JavaBeans components, allowing for a more modular and loosely coupled design. This makes it easier to develop and maintain complex Java applications, particularly those with graphical user interfaces.
